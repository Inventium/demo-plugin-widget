# WordPress demo plugin for demonstrating widget

Widgets are pretty cool, and give a WordPress operator 
a lot of power to extend functionality.

This demo plugin provides a very basic set of widget
functions, which can be easily extended.

Note that the form field are handled in instance methods
for the widget class. In the future output fields should 
handled in the same way.
